Step to make bt_cheetah work:

Install Cheetah USB rules:

In order to be able to read the Biotac data via the Cheetah SPI-USB board you first have to copy the udev rules

Download the Cheetah SPI board drivers tp-usb-drivers-v2.10.zip from http://www.totalphase.com/products/cheetah_spi/

Unzip the folder unzip tp-usb-drivers-v2.10.zip

Copy the udev rules sudo cp tp-usb-drivers-v2.10/linux/99-totalphase.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/


Download the Appropriate API for your machine from http://www.totalphase.com/products/cheetah-api/

Copy the library file (cheetah.dll or cheetah.so) from the downloaded zip. Paste the file into the Syntouch application folder (the bt_cheetah folder with biotac.h, biotac.c, etc.
files).
For Windows: Copy cheetah.dll under the “c” subfolder
